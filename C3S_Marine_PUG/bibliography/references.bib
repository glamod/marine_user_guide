Abstract = {{The quality of in situ sea surface temperatures (NOAASSTs) is critical for
   calibration and validation of satellite NOAASSTs. In situ NOAASSTs come from
   different countries, agencies, and platforms. As a result, their quality
   is often suboptimal, nonuniform, and measurement-type specific. This
   paper describes a system developed at the National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the in situ NOAASST Quality Monitor
   (iQuam; www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/sod/sst/iquam/). It performs three
   major functions with the Global Telecommunication System (Gts) data: 1)
   quality controls (QC) in situ NOAA SSTs, using Bayesian reference and buddy
   checks similar to those adopted in the Met Office, in addition to
   providing basic screenings, such as duplicate removal, plausibility,
   platform track, and NOAASST spike checks; 2) monitors quality-controlled
   NOAASSTs online, in near-real time; and 3) serves reformatted Gts NOAASST data
   to NOAA and external users with quality flags appended. Currently,
   iQuam's web page displays global monthly maps of measurement locations
   stratified by four in situ platform types (drifters, ships, and tropical
   and coastal moorings) as well as their corresponding in situ minus
   reference NOAASST statistics. Time series of all corresponding NOAASST and QC
   statistics are also trended. The web page user can also monitor
   individual in situ platforms. The current status of iQuam and ongoing
   improvements are discussed.}},

Title = {{A new methodology for homogenization of 19th century marine air
   temperature data}},

Abstract = {{A new data set of over 43,000 surface marine air temperature (Mat)
   records covering the years 1795-1843 is described and a new methodology
   proposed for the homogenization of historical Mat data. The data consist
   of observations made at 1200 LT, as this was overwhelmingly the most
   common observation time in use before 1850. Simultaneous sea surface
   temperature (NOAASST) is present in only 3.6\% of records. For this reason,
   extension of historical marine temperature fluctuations back to the
   early 19th century will need to rely on Mat data. Nonstandard
   thermometer exposures and observing practices introduce nonclimatic
   biases into the data. Here I propose new correction schemes to account
   for the major sources of bias in the data. Similar principles are
   applicable to post-1850 data as well. The seeming disadvantage of
   nonstandard thermometer exposures and local noon observation time
   actually provides information that is used to adjust and homogenize the
   data. Unscreened thermometers absorb seasonally and geographically
   varying short wave radiation and give daytime temperatures that are too
   high. Calculation of grid box mean temperature anomalies, DeltaT(a),
   using a modern nighttime climatology highlights these biases.
   Ship-to-ship variations in thermometer calibration and performance are
   measured and adjusted using tropical DeltaT(a) as a reference.
   Individual ships have large biases tin excess of 1 degreesC) which can
   dominate observed patterns of temperature anomalies in individual years.
   Using data from low latitudes, a regression equation is produced that
   predicts DeltaT(a) as a function of net radiation. Predicted DeltaT(a)
   at higher latitudes is then compared to observed values of DeltaT(a) in
   the historical record to detect biases arising from internally generated
   ship's heat. The advantage to this approach is that NOAASST data are not
   needed to correct Mat data, thereby preserving both as independent
   marine temperature records. Finally, a correction for nonstandard
   thermometer exposure is made. This last correction is made by comparing
   historical and modern noon minus nighttime temperature differences. The
   difference between the two is considered to be due to nonstandard
   thermometer exposure in the historical data. Since the local Mat diurnal
   range is assumed to be independent of secular changes in temperature the
   historical adjusted nighttime marine air temperature can be compared to
   modern climatologies.}},

Abstract = {{The International Comprehensive Ocean -Atmosphere Data Set (Icoads),
   release 2.1 (1784-2002), is the largest available set of in situ marine
   observations. Observations from ships include instrument measurements
   and visual estimates, and data from moored and drifting buoys are
   exclusively instrumental. The Icoads collection is constructed from many
   diverse data sources, and made inhomogeneous by the changes in observing
   systems and recording practices used throughout the period of record,
   which is over two centuries. Nevertheless, it is a key reference data
   set that documents the long-term environmental state, provides input to
   a variety of critical climate and other research applications, and
   serves as a basis for many associated products and analyses.
   The observational database is augmented with higher level Icoads data
   products. The observed data are synthesized to products by computing
   statistical summaries, on a monthly basis, for samples within 2 degrees
   latitude x 2 degrees longitude and V x V boxes beginning in 1800 and
   1960 respectively. For each resolution the summaries are computed using
   two different data mixtures and quality control criteria. This partially
   controls and contrasts the effects of changing observing systems and
   accounts for periods with greater climate variability. The Icoads
   observations and products are freely distributed worldwide.
   The standard Icoads release is supplemented in several ways; additional
   summaries are produced using experimental quality control, additional
   observations are made available in advance of their formal blending into
   a release, and metadata that define recent ships' physical
   characteristics and instruments are available. Copyright (c) 2005 Royal

abstract = {Abstract One of the largest sources of uncertainty in estimates of global temperature change is that associated with the correction of systematic errors in sea surface temperature (SST) measurements. Despite recent work to quantify and reduce these errors throughout the historical record, differences between analyses remain larger than can be explained by the estimated uncertainties. We revisited the method used to estimate systematic errors and their uncertainties in version 3 of the Met Office Hadley Centre SST data set, HadSST. Using comparisons with oceanographic temperature profiles, we make estimates of biases associated with engine room measurements and insulated buckets and constrain the ranges of two of the more uncertain parameters in the bias estimation: the timing of the transition from uninsulated to insulated buckets in the middle twentieth century and the estimated fractions of different measurement methods used. Here, we present HadSST.4.0.0.0, based on release 3.0.0 and 3.0.1 of the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set supplemented by drifting buoy measurements from the Copernicus Marine Environmental Monitoring Service. HadSST.4.0.0.0 comprises a 200-member “ensemble” in which uncertain parameters in the SST bias scheme are varied to generate a range of adjustments. The evolution of global average SST in the new data set is similar to that in other SST data sets, and the difference between data sets is reduced during the middle twentieth century. However, the changes also highlight a discrepancy in the global-average difference between adjusted SST and marine air temperature in the early 1990s and hence between HadSST.4.0.0.0 and, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration SST data set, ERSSTv5.},
