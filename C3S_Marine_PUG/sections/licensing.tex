\section{Data licensing and permissions}
The marine data builds upon several decades of effort under ICOADS. Since its outset ICOADS has been served under a fully open licence by NCAR\footnote{https://www2.ucar.edu/terms-of-use} and NOAA\footnote{https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/about/datapolicy.html} . Any business built upon ICOADS, e.g. a derivation of the data to provide guidance to marine shipping companies, is perfectly acceptable and encouraged. Further, there are no limits to re-use and third party data sharing. Source decks which did not meet these restrictions were not ingested into ICOADS. There are no 'hidden' holdings of more restricted IPR available within ICOADS. There will, however, be marine data (e.g. from research vessels, military, coastguard, bio-monitoring) that have not been prioritised for accession for a wide variety of reasons (including resources, quality, volume, range of parameters, complexity and perhaps uncertain IPR).
